# CI Pipeline for Automated Testing
name: CI Pipeline

# Trigger the pipeline on push or pull request
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# Define the CI pipeline jobs
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use Ubuntu as the OS for CI

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up the environment (Install necessary tools)
      - name: Set up Python  # Example for Python, but can be customized for other languages
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'  # Set Python version, change if needed

      # Step 3: Install dependencies/tools required for testing
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y curl git build-essential  # Install necessary tools
          curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
          sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
          sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip  # Example for Python testing tools

      # Step 4: Extract necessary repositories (i.e., source code and test scripts)
      - name: Clone test repositories
        run: |
          git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-source-repo.git
          git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-test-repo.git

      # Step 5: Setup environment for tests (Install test tools)
      - name: Install test dependencies
        run: |
          cd your-test-repo
          pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python test dependencies
          npm install  # Example for Node.js tests

      # Step 6: Run the tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd your-test-repo
          pytest tests/  # Example for Python tests, replace with your test command
          # Or use other test command like `npm test` for Node.js

      # Step 7: Output the test results
      - name: Output test results
        run: |
          # Capture the output and save it as a result
          pytest tests/ > result.log
          cat result.log  # Output the test result log

      # Step 8: Handle issues if found (Optional, for example, handling failed tests)
      - name: Check for test failures
        if: failure()  # Only runs if previous steps fail
        run: |
          echo "Tests failed. Check logs for details."  # Example, could be customized
          exit 1

      # Optional: Clean up environment (e.g., remove temporary files)
      - name: Clean up
        run: |
          rm -rf your-source-repo your-test-repo  # Cleanup cloned repositories
